This is the last part of the series we will concern ourselves with adding new features to the game. We just have two more features to add, and then we will move on to polishing everything up and deploying the game over the next two parts.

As a reminder, in the [last part](/2024/11/16/godot-golang-mmo-part-9/), we added a hiscores and a leaderboard to the game. In this part, we want to:
1. Give players a random chance to drop a spore and lose mass over time, giving them a reason to keep eating as much as possible
2. Allow players to search the leaderboard for themselves or their friends

This should be a shorter post than usual, since we should be very familiar with the codebase, tools, and workflow by now. Let's get started!
