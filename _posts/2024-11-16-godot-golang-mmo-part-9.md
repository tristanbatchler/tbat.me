We are approaching the end of this series, having just finished [allowing players to eat each other and grow in size](/2024/11/15/godot-golang-mmo-part-8), but we are still lacking a permanent way for players to see how they rank against others. I think it's time to add a hiscore leaderboard to our game, so let's get started!

*Coming soon...*
