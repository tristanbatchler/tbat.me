[Last time](/2024/11/18/godot-golang-mmo-part-10) we just finished adding the final features of our MMO. Now, with deployment right around the corner, we could **really** use some polish. In this part, we will be focusing solely on that: making the game look and feel as good as possible. That way, players will be more likely to stick around and enjoy the game. Let's get started!

*Coming soon...*
