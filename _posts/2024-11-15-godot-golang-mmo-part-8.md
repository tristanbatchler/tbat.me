Welcome back! In the [last part](/2024/11/14/godot-golang-mmo-part-7), we added spores to our game, and gave players the opportunity to eat them. Today, we are going to expand upon that by letting the server decide if the player should grow after eating spores, then tell all other players about the change. This inherently will give rise to the concept of scores, and combined with the possibility for players to eat each other, we will have a competitive game.

Coming soon!
