Welcome back to yet another lesson! In the [previous lesson](/2022/11/21/godot-python-mmo-part-2.html), we finished setting up authentication for our chatroom, thus completing our short-term goal.

In this lesson, we will really kick it up a notch by attaching the notion of position and movement to our players, making this feel more like a game.

[If you prefer, you can view this lesson on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA1tuaTAYPbHz8PvTWpFYGag0L6AdYgLH).

I highly recommend you go through the [first](/2022/11/20/godot-python-mmo-part-1.html) and [second](/2022/11/21/godot-python-mmo-part-2.html) parts, if you haven't already. If do you want to start here without viewing the previous lessons, however, you can visit [the **Releases** section of the official GitHub repository](https://github.com/tristanbatchler/official-godot-python-mmo/releases), and download the **End of lesson 2** code by expanding **Assets** and downloading [Source code (zip)](https://github.com/tristanbatchler/official-godot-python-mmo/archive/refs/tags/v0.2.zip).
