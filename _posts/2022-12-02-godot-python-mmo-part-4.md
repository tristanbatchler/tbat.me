Welcome back to yet another lesson! In the [previous lesson](/2022/11/22/godot-python-mmo-part-3), we finished setting up our actors who can move around in the game, kicking off our long-term goal.

In this lesson, we will discuss the lesson 3 homework solutions, and focus on ironing out any bugs and making small improvements.

As always, you can visit [the **Releases** section of the official GitHub repository](https://github.com/tristanbatchler/official-godot-python-mmo/releases), and download the **End of lesson 3** code by expanding **Assets** and downloading [Source code (zip)](https://github.com/tristanbatchler/official-godot-python-mmo/archive/refs/tags/v0.3.zip). You will need to refer to parts [1](/2022/11/20/godot-python-mmo-part-1) and [2](/2022/11/21/godot-python-mmo-part-2) to set up the virtual environment, set up the database, and run the server (if you haven't already).

## A sneak peek
Here's a quick look at what we'll be finishing up by the end of this lesson:

## Homework solutions
Here is the solution to last lesson's homework. Here is a reminder of the problem we have to fix:
> When you log out and log in again, you will always just start again in the top-left corner.

And the hint was:
> Use [Django's model.save](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/models/instances/#saving-objects) function somewhere in this code!

So the problems stems from the fact that we aren't saving the actor's position to the database. The way to save something to the database is by calling Django's `.save` method on the model we need to save.

What is the model we need to save? The `InstancedEntity` component of our `Actor` model contains the `x` and `y` attributes, so we need to save that. 

Where do we need to do this? Preferably at the end of the `_update_position` function in `protocol.py`, right before we return `True`.
```python
self._actor.instanced_entity.save()
```

It might also be a good idea to save the actor generally in the `onClose` function, to make sure we get the final sync before the client disconnects cleanly. Although that is probably not needed in most cases.
```python
# Override
    def onClose(self, wasClean, code, reason):
        if self._actor:
            self._actor.save()
        self.factory.players.remove(self)
        print(f"Websocket connection closed{' unexpectedly' if not wasClean else ' cleanly'} with code {code}: {reason}")
```

On the client side, we need to make sure we are initialising our actor to the server position when we first receive it. This is done by adding the following code to the `update` function of `Actor.gd`, just after where we set `server_position`:
```gdscript
if not initialised_position:
    initialised_position = true
    body.position = server_position
    if is_player:
        _player_target = server_position
```

We need to define `initialised_position` at the top of the file, too:
```gdscript
var initialised_position: bool = false
```

We might get in trouble if the first update is called before our KinematicBody2D node is ready, so we should make sure we only update the actor after everything is ready. For this, we need to change the default behaviour in `model.gd`. Replace the whole contents of the file to the following (the notable change is we are not calling the `update` function in the `init` function any more):
```gdscript
extends Node

var initial_data: Dictionary
var data: Dictionary = {}

func init(init_data: Dictionary):
    initial_data = init_data
    return self

func update(new_model: Dictionary):
    data = new_model
```

Then we can let the actor call the first update once all its nodes are ready. Add this `_ready` function to `Actor.gd`:
```gdscript
func _ready():
    update(initial_data)
```

That should be it! Test your game to make sure you can log in, move somewhere in the middle of the screen, and log out. Log in again and you should be put right back where you left off!

Note: this is just one approach at a solution, and yours may have been different! There's a decent chance your solution is better than mine, so feel free to call me out in [the Discord](https://discord.gg/tzUpXtTPRd) ðŸ™‚

## Fixing the other problems
Recall problem #3 from last time:
> An invisible actor who suddenly moves will appear to come out of the top-left corner and move to their proper position.

You might notice that, by fixing problem #1 (above), we have also fixed this! That's because, when we broadcast our model to everyone by moving, their clients are now equipped to properly add our actor to the correct location and we won't be spawning in the top-left corner any more.

Finally, let's address problem #2:
> When a new player joins and starts moving, you will see them pop up right away, but new players won't see you unless you move. In other words, if you are staying perfectly still when someone new joins, you will be invisible to them.

This one's a little trickier, but it's nothing we can't handle.

Firstly, we need to make sure newly connecting clients are broadcasting their model to everyone who is already connectedâ€”not just themselves. So replace the `send_client` call for the initial `ModelData` packet in the `LOGIN` state to a `broadcast` call:
```python
self.broadcast(packet.ModelDataPacket(models.create_dict(self._actor)))
```

Next, we need to keep track of which other players our protocol knows about. In `protocol.py`, add the following extra member variable in the `__init__` constructor:
```python
self._known_others: set['GameServerProtocol'] = set()
```

This set will hold all the other protocols who have made themselves visible to us in any way.

Next, let's make sure we can add to our known list of other protocols once we receive a model data packet, so add this to the `PLAY` state where we process `ModelData` packets:
```python
if sender not in self._known_others:
    sender.onPacket(self, packet.ModelDataPacket(models.create_dict(self._actor)))
    self._known_others.add(sender)
```

So if we get a packet from someone not in our known list of others, we:
1. Send them a model packet describing our own actor
2. Add them to our list of known others

Note that sending the other protocol our own actor model (1) will, in turn, trigger them to perform the above actions, because they are receiving a `ModelData` packet themselves. This does cause them to send us their model a second time, but by then, they will be known to us so we don't get stuck in an infinite loop. This is slightly wasteful though, but I think the simplicity of this solution warrants the extra packet sent.

It turns out, this small change to `protocol.py` completely fixes problem #2. When someone new joins, they broadcast their model to everyone. Then, everyone will broadcast their own models in return (just one time), hence preventing anyone from staying "invisible".

## Improving performance
We can lessen the amount of data we are sending over the network by only sending the relevant changes to existing models, rather than sending the full model every time. We will call this a `ModelDelta` now instead of a `ModelData`. A `ModelDelta` *might* contain the full data, like when you send it to someone for the first time, but more generally, it can contain less than the full data.

Let's start by renaming our `ModelData` action/packet to `ModelDelta`. The best way to do this is probably to click the **Search** button in VS Code on the left, type `ModelData` in the **Search** box, and then type `ModelDelta` in the **Replace** box. Then click the **Replace all** button.

Next, we need a new function to calculate the delta based on some before-and-after model information. In `models.py`, add the following new function:
```python
def get_delta_dict(model_dict_before: dict, model_dict_after: dict):
    """
    Returns a dictionary containing all differences between the supplied model dicts
    (except for the ID and Model Type).
    """

    delta: dict = {}

    for k in model_dict_before.keys() & model_dict_after.keys():  # Intersection of keysets
        v_before = model_dict_before[k]
        v_after = model_dict_after[k]

        if k in ("id", "model_type"):
            delta[k] = v_after
        if v_before == v_after:
            continue

        if not isinstance(v_before, dict):
            delta[k] = v_after
        else:
            delta[k] = get_delta_dict(v_before, v_after)

    return delta
```

We supply two model dictionaries (before & after), and output a dictionary containing their differences. The output dictionary will keep any `id` or `model_type` fields, though, as these are required for all model packets.

The function is conceptually simple: we loop through all the keys the two supplied dictionaries have in common, and compare each dictionary's values:
* If the values are differing or the key is `id` or `model_type`, we choose to keep the "after" value.
* Otherwise, if the values are differing dictionaries, we need to recurse in a step to compare these dictionaries.

At the end, we have a fully recursive dictionary of only `id` and `model_type` keys as well as any keys/values that changed between the before and after dictionaries. This will be perfect for sending and receiving in a packet.

Now we just need to modify the `tick` function in `protocol.py` to only broadcast the *delta* if we update the actor's position. We will use our new `get_delta_dict` function to do this. The logic at the end of the `tick` function should now look like this:
```python
# To do when there are no packets to process
elif self._state == self.PLAY: 
    actor_dict_before: dict = models.create_dict(self._actor)
    if self._update_position():
        actor_dict_after: dict = models.create_dict(self._actor)
        self.broadcast(packet.ModelDeltaPacket(models.get_delta_dict(actor_dict_before, actor_dict_after)))
```

Inside Godot, we need to interpret the model updates slightly differently now inside `Actor.gd`, because it's not guaranteed that any of the keys we are trying to access actually exist in the dictionary any more. So basically we just need to add a bunch of `if` statements checking if the diction has the key we want to use. Change the `update` function to the following:
```gdscript
func update(new_model: Dictionary):
    .update(new_model)
    
    if new_model.has("instanced_entity"):
        var ientity = new_model["instanced_entity"]
        
        if ientity.has("x") and ientity.has("y"):
            server_position = Vector2(float(ientity["x"]), float(ientity["y"]))
            
            if not initialised_position:
                initialised_position = true
                body.position = server_position
                if is_player:
                    _player_target = server_position
            
        if ientity.has("entity"):
            var entity = ientity["entity"]
            if entity.has("name"):
                actor_name = ientity["entity"]["name"]
        
                if label:
                    label.text = actor_name
```

And that's it! To see the improvement, let's suppose we are moving only horizontally and look at the update data we would have been sending to the client before and compare with what we are sending now.

**Before (full data)â€”223 bytes**
```json
{
    "a": "ModelData",
    "p0": {
        "id": 2,
        "model_type": "Actor",
        "user": 2,
        "instanced_entity": {
            "id": 12,
            "model_type": "InstancedEntity",
            "x": 198.21274496741077,
            "y": 78.41678496432130,
            "entity": {
                "id": 2,
                "model_type": "Entity",
                "name": "tristan"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**After (delta)â€”138 bytes**
```json
{
    "a": "ModelDelta",
    "p0": {
        "id": 12,
        "model_type": "Actor",
        "instanced_entity": {
            "id": 12,
            "model_type": "InstancedEntity",
            "x": 198.21274496741077
        }
    }
}
```

I have formatted the data to make it easier to read and view, but in reality, there would be no line breaks, spaces, or indents in the data. The number of bytes indicated in the heading is for the real life case.

So you can see we have nearly halved the number of bytes we send for updates to our model in this case. As actors become more complicated, however, this would become more and more efficient so is definitely an improvement worth making early on.

## Rubber banding
You might notice we never actually set the player's position to equal the server position in `Actor.gd`. This is because it can be quite a jarring experience for the player if they are even slightly out of sync with the server. While we do everything we can to stop this from happening, getting out of sync with the server is inevitable over long periods of game time.

When the difference between the client's position and the server's position is great enough, we'd like to "autocorrect" by snapping the player back to the server's position. This is known as rubber banding. 

To do this, we need to define a rubber banding radius, which describes *how far is too far?* I'll choose 200 pixels, which is significant enough to warrant correction, and not so small that it will be disruptive to the player. Add this to `Actor.gd`:
```gdscript
var rubber_band_radius: float = 200
```

Then, in the `update` function, add the following `elif` clause to the `if not initialised_position` statement (i.e., we do this if we have already initialised the player's position in a previous update, and this update is telling us a *new* position):
```gdscript
elif (body.position - server_position).length() > rubber_band_radius:
    # Rubber band if body position too far away from server position
    body.position = server_position
```

That's all you need to do to implement rubber banding. A good way to test this is to force the client to go out of sync with the server by setting the `speed` variable to something much different from `70` (which is what the server is expecting). For example, set `speed` to `200` in `Actor.gd` and leave the server code alone. Test your game, and notice the player is snapped back every time it is more than 200 pixels away from the expected server position.

![A contrived example of rubber banding](/assets/css/images/posts/2022/12/02/godot-python-mmo-part-4/rubberbanding.gif)

## A quick bug fix
There is a really rare bug, where the server can crash if it tries to send a message directly to a client who has just disconnected. Let's fix this really quickly with a simple `try`-`except` block. First, let's import the following to `protocol.py`:
```python
from autobahn.exception import Disconnected
```

Now, in the `send_client` function, just replace the `sendMessage` call with the following:
```python
try:
    self.sendMessage(b)
except Disconnected:
    print(f"Couldn't send {p} because client disconnected.")
```

## Optimising for mobile
Currently, the game doesn't work too well on mobile because focusing the chatbox requires the user to either press **Enter**, or click inside it. Currently, the only way to send a chat message is by pressing **Enter**.

Of course, mobile users don't have an **Enter** key, so we need to add a button to send the message as well. As well as this, currently, clicking any UI in the chatbox causes the player to start moving in that direction which is not what we want.

Let's add the button first, and then address the problem of clicking UI elements.

### Adding the send button
Let's add a **Button** node to our chatbox scene. Open up **Chatbox.tscn**, right-click the **HBoxContainer** node, and add a new child of type **Button**.

You can set the button text to **Send** in the inspector properties.

Inside the `Chatbox.gd` script, let's add a reference to our button at the top of the file:
```gdscript
onready var button = get_node("CanvasLayer/VBoxContainer/HBoxContainer/Button")
```

In the `_ready` function of `Chatbox.gd`, connect the button's `pressed` signal to a new function called `button_pressed`:
```gdscript
button.connect("pressed", self, "button_pressed")
```

Finally, add a new function called `button_pressed`, which, in turn, just calls the `text_entered` function with the input field's existing text:
```gdscript
func button_pressed():
    text_entered(input_field.text)
```


### Don't move when clicking inside the chatbox
This is quite a simple fix. Inside `Main.gd`, we should be using a built-in function called `_unhandled_input` instead of regular `_input`. `_unhandled_input` is only called when the user input event is not already handled by something else automatically. For example, button presses and input line focusing is already handled separately, so we do not check for that in the `_unhandled_input` function.

If you test the game again now, you will find that clicking the chatbox UI won't cause your player to move, which is great. Unfortunately, you will find that even clicking inside the RichTextField chat log will prevent the player from moving. This is not great.

To fix this issue, go back to the Godot Chatbox scene editor, select the **VBoxContainer** node, and set **Filter** to **Ignore** under **Mouse** settings in the right-hand side inspector. Now repeat this process for the **RichTextLabel** node. This will tell Godot to ignore any mouse input for that field, so it can be handled by our `Main.gd` script.


## Test the HTML5 export on mobile (if you have Wi-Fi)
Let's first do a quick test to make sure everything is working as usual. If so, read on to test the game on your mobile phone.

Your phone will need to be connected to Wi-Fi on the same network your computer is running. You will also need to know your computer's local IP address. This means you will need to open a new terminal (keep the old one still open and running) and run the following depending on your OS:

### Mac/Linux
```shell
ifconfig | grep -Eo 'inet (addr:)?([0-9]*\.){3}[0-9]*' | grep -Eo '([0-9]*\.){3}[0-9]*' | grep -v '127.0.0.1'
```

### Windows
```powershell
(Get-NetIPAddress | Where-Object {$_.AddressState -eq "Preferred" -and $_.ValidLifetime -lt "24:00:00"}).IPAddress
```
Either command should print your local IP address.

Once we know our computer's IP address and your phone is on the same network, let's re-export our game to HTML5. 

Firstly, edit the `127.0.0.1` in `Main.gd` and change it to the IP address for your machine.

Now, in Godot, go to **Project > Export** and this time, be sure to check the **Experimental Virtual Keyboard** option to allow mobile devices to type in the line edit fields.
![HTML5 Export Settings](/assets/css/images/posts/2022/12/02/godot-python-mmo-part-4/project-export.png)

When you click **Export Project**, and it asks you to save the file, make sure you call it `index.html` and save it inside a folder you will remember. I would recommend saving it inside your project folder under `client/HTML5/`.

Next, open a terminal window inside the folder you saved `index.html` to and run the following command:
```powershell
python -m http.server 80
```

You should see the following output:
```
Serving HTTP on :: port 80 (http://[::]:80/) ...
```

Now open your preferred web browser app on your phone (e.g., Chrome, Safari, etc.) and type your computer's local IP address into the URL bar. Once you go to this address, it should start loading your game! Try playing the game and make sure everything works.

You might notice the experimental virtual keyboard has some display issues, but this particular feature of Godot is still quite early days and should improve. I've found it to at least be functional.

You should still be able to log in to your game if you run it on your PC without needing to change the IP address back in `Main.gd`. If it doesn't work, though, you should just change it back to `127.0.0.1`.

## Conclusion
We're getting very close to the end of this course. In the next part, we will be focusing on allowing the user to choose an avatar during registration, and prettying up the client side with graphics.

After part 5 is released, I will be creating ad-hoc lessons per request so you guys can vote for what you want.
