title: ยง7 Adding Objectives + Polishing the Godot 4 Go MMO
description: So we have a basic functioning MMO, but it's not very fun and movement is a bit janky. Let's make things a bit easier on the eyes and keep players engaged with objectives.

Nice to see you again! In [the last post](/2024/11/11/godot-golang-mmo-part-6), we finally got some gameplay down, and we left off in a pretty good spot. We have a basic space where players can move around and spot each other, but it is very unpolished and I wouldn't really call it a "game" since it lacks objectives! Let's fix that today by adding some spores to collect and let the player grow. We will also be making the movement more fluid and restoring the chat functionality we kinda lost in the last post. Let's get right into it!
