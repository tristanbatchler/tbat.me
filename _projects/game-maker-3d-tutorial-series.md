I designed and presented a beginner game development course to tens of thousands of viewers. The videos on YouTube are well-received and I estimate thousands of people have followed along to create their very own 3D game framework with the Game Maker engine. 

Although the version of Game Maker used in the series is now outdated, it introduced a good technique to help beginners get started with their own projects at the time. I do not recommend viewing the series any more, but have left it here for historical purposes.
