This is a completely free, five-lesson course intended for intermediate-to-advanced users of Python and beginners of Godot / networking. 

I introduce my unique framework for an authorative websockets server, and teach how to integrate it with a relational database with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), and a highly cross-platform client with [the Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/). 

Videos which follow these posts are also published on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLA1tuaTAYPbHz8PvTWpFYGag0L6AdYgLH).
