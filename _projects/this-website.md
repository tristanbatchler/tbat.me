This website is a static site generated with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), aiming to be as easy and lightweight as possible. It is open-source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/tristanbatchler/tbat.me).

I am using Netlify's image CDN for dynamically serving optimised images, and I have a few custom plugins to help with SEO and social media sharing. I have also written a few custom Liquid tags to help with the layout of the site.

I enjoy having full control over the design and functionality of my website, and being able to host it for free. Although web development is not my main focus, I find it a fun and rewarding hobby. I am always looking for ways to improve the site, so if you have any feedback or suggestions, please let me know!
